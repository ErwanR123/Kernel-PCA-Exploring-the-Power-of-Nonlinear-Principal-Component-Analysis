# Kernel-PCA-Exploring-the-Power-of-Nonlinear-Principal-Component-Analysis
This project explores Kernel PCA for analyzing nonlinear datasets. It compares different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF, sigmoid, cosine) to showcase their effects on data transformation and visualization. Part of a Masterâ€™s thesis, it highlights how Kernel PCA surpasses traditional PCA in capturing complex structures.
